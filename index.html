                The words left hanging in the air,<br>
                Unable to catch them,<br>
                They fall to the ground.<br>
                Buried deep inside not to live,<br>
                Not to die but remain unknown,<br>
                Hidden from people left alone,<br>
                Covered in a blanket<br>
                Not long ago, left behind.<br>
                <br>
                I still dream of you,<br>
                Not too much,<br>
                But sometimes, when it rains,<br>
                My mind wanders to your home,<br>
                Thinking of you.</p>

                <p>His eyes burn with rage—<br>
                trying to strangle the crowd<br>
                with nothing but his looks.<br>
                <br>
                He's angry.<br>
                They never understood him,<br>
                mocked him,<br>
                beat him down.<br>
                <br>
                He is a man.<br>
                He is a god.<br>
                He is human.<br>
                <br>
                But he is nothing,<br>
                nothing but flesh and dirt.<br>
                <br>
                And he will return to the dirt.<br>
                <br>
                In the end, nothing matters.<br>
                Everything will be forgotten.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Love</h3>
                <p>It's not love<br>
                if you're constantly thinking about them—<br>
                that's obsession.<br>
                They're two very different entities.<br>
                Love is caring for the person,<br>
                not for who they are<br>
                or what they are.<br>
                People have changed the meaning of love<br>
                with their petty games.<br>
                Even the kids these days say,<br>
                "I manipulate her/him,<br>
                I can make them cry whenever I want."<br>
                "They're weak,<br>
                I can do anything I want to them."<br>
                In truth, love never asks for anything in return—<br>
                not even the love they gave you.<br>
                The most grateful creatures<br>
                are those who seek love,<br>
                but never get anything.<br>
                Such pitiful, miserable souls.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card p-4 section">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">/???</h3>
                <p>He fell in love,<br>
                watching her dance in front of the crowd,<br>
                each movement a whisper of freedom.<br>
                But once they were together,<br>
                he caught her grace,<br>
                never allowing her to dance again—<br>
                not once, nor did she rebel.<br>
                Is this love?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card p-4 section">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">She is......</h3>
                <p>She is the poem unwritten,<br>
                A melody that can be found anywhere.<br>
                More beauty, more heart than any words said,<br>
                A kind soul in between these filthy mortals.<br>
                Her presence brightens one's day;<br>
                Her eyes can change from sad to happy,<br>
                Turning tears into laughter.<br>
                <br>
                She is a blessing to have.<br>
                She helps others before caring for herself.<br>
                She is kind, looks after her parents;<br>
                That kindness may hurt her,<br>
                But she doesn't abandon that kindness.<br>
                <br>
                She sees her parents' struggles<br>
                And helps them to her best.<br>
                Her wish is to make them the proudest parents on earth.<br>
                She loves her friends<br>
                And tries to make them better.<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes she acts dumb,<br>
                Like she doubts herself,<br>
                That she won't succeed,<br>
                Always worries<br>
                That what she's done<br>
                Isn't enough.<br>
                She pushes through with her little strength.<br>
                She persists, she fights,<br>
                And she gets what she wants;<br>
                Sometimes she even achieves the impossible.<br>
                <br>
                She says<br>
                She is not beautiful.<br>
                True, she's not a model,<br>
                But that doesn't mean she's not perfect.<br>
                The way those eyes shine<br>
                Like earth kissed by spring rain,<br>
                Promising life and happiness,<br>
                Mirrored by her wide smile,<br>
                Though not often seen—<br>
                Just one smile from her<br>
                Is like a ray of sunshine<br>
                Through those broken windows,<br>
                Bringing light into darkness<br>
                That knew nothing but darkness,<br>
                Warm enough to melt the walls of the coldest hearts.<br>
                <br>
                I say<br>
                She's often right,<br>
                But the subject<br>
                She becomes herself<br>
                And she's far from the truth.<br>
                She's absolutely wonderful,<br>
                A perfect person,<br>
                A perfect friend,<br>
                The most beautiful woman on earth.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">My rose</h3>
                <p>A rose that grows in the shade<br>
                Beautiful but without light<br>
                It's thorns ready to tear flesh<br>
                While her eyes hold a thousand complaints<br>
                <br>
                She smiles despite the pain<br>
                Hides her tears behind the scent<br>
                She wishes for escape<br>
                But fears losing her way<br>
                <br>
                She is beautiful her delicate grace<br>
                Her heart is heavy<br>
                Waiting for sun that is yet to come<br>
                Like a distant dream<br>
                <br>
                In the quiet night, the sky calls<br>
                They whisper about her among the clouds<br>
                Whisper about hope<br>
                That tomorrow might shine despite the clouds.</p>

                <p>I’ve met so many people,<br>

                It’s always those brown eyes I see,<br>

                <br>
                You kissed my lips softly<br>
                And all I could think of<br>
                Was the way we could be if we just let go,<br>
                A perfect picture of love<br>
                Painted with every moment we shared.<br>
                <br>
                But those moments faded like a forgotten dream,<br>
                Chased away by the noise of the world<br>

                I’ve met so many people,<br>

                The food like lava burns my tongue<br>

                Her wild heart that never stays.<br>
                Yet for her, the world stands still,<br>
                Her sigh breaks men like me.<br>

                A gentle hand, a steady will,<br>
                And when she smiles, the stars ignite.<br>

                For love is her, and she is love,<br>
