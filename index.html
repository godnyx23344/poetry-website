                <pre class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
Simple but never dead
The words left hanging in the air,
Unable to catch them,
They fall to the ground.
Buried deep inside not to live,
Not to die but remain unknown,
Hidden from people left alone,
Covered in a blanket
Not long ago, left behind.

I still dream of you,
Not too much,
But sometimes, when it rains,
My mind wanders to your home,
Thinking of you.

                <pre class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
His eyes burn with rage—
trying to strangle the crowd
with nothing but his looks.

He's angry.
They never understood him,
mocked him,
beat him down.

He is a man.
He is a god.
He is human.

But he is nothing,
nothing but flesh and dirt.

And he will return to the dirt.

In the end, nothing matters.
Everything will be forgotten.

                <pre class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
It's not love
if you're constantly thinking about them—
that's obsession.
They're two very different entities.
Love is caring for the person,
not for who they are
or what they are.
People have changed the meaning of love
with their petty games.
Even the kids these days say,
"I manipulate her/him,
I can make them cry whenever I want."
"They're weak,
I can do anything I want to them."
In truth, love never asks for anything in return—
not even the love they gave you.
The most grateful creatures
are those who seek love,
but never get anything.
Such pitiful, miserable souls

                <pre class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
He fell in love,
watching her dance in front of the crowd,
each movement a whisper of freedom.
But once they were together,
he caught her grace,
never allowing her to dance again—
not once, nor did she rebel.
Is this love?

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">"She is......"</h2>
                <pre class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
She is the poem unwritten,
A melody that can be found anywhere.
More beauty, more heart than any words said,
A kind soul in between these filthy mortals.
Her presence brightens one's day;
Her eyes can change from sad to happy,
Turning tears into laughter.

She is a blessing to have.
She helps others before caring for herself.
She is kind, looks after her parents;
That kindness may hurt her,
But she doesn't abandon that kindness.

She sees her parents' struggles
And helps them to her best.
Her wish is to make them the proudest parents on earth.
She loves her friends
And tries to make them better.

Sometimes she acts dumb,
Like she doubts herself,
That she won't succeed,
Always worries
That what she's done
Isn't enough.
She pushes through with her little strength.
She persists, she fights,
And she gets what she wants;
Sometimes she even achieves the impossible.

She says
She is not beautiful.
True, she's not a model,
But that doesn't mean she's not perfect.
The way those eyes shine
Like earth kissed by spring rain,
Promising life and happiness,
Mirrored by her wide smile,
Though not often seen—
Just one smile from her
Is like a ray of sunshine
Through those broken windows,
Bringing light into darkness
that knew nothing but darkness,
Warm enough to melt the walls of the coldest hearts.

I say
She's often right,
But the subject
She becomes herself
And she's far from the truth.
She's absolutely wonderful,
A perfect person,
A perfect friend,
The most beautiful woman on earth

                <pre class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
A rose that grows in the shade
Beautiful but without light
It's thorns ready to tear flesh
While her eyes hold a thousand complaints

She smiles despite the pain
Hides her tears behind the scent
She wishes for escape
But fears losing her way

She is beautiful her delicate grace
Her heart is heavy
Waiting for sun that is yet to come
Like a distant dream

In the quiet night, the sky calls
They whisper about her among the clouds
Whisper about hope
That tomorrow might shine despite the clouds

She stood on the stage in her golden white dress,
Like an angel.
Her serene laughter echoed through the hall,
And I just stood there, watching her.
From afar, it was sweet yet painful,
Perhaps one day, we will stand next to each other

If not today, or tomorrow,
maybe one day, we'll find love.
for we are destined to be together.

I live in a home with monsters
We laugh under the roof always giggling
Their eyes glow in the shadows, sharp teeth,
Their smiles are more wicked
                                        
The food like lava burns my tongue
And milk drips from the twisted trees
I hate living like a caged rat
Yet i love these weird monsters
Weird am i?
                                        
One day i'll take you to my house
Nestled deep in the forest
Where the trees whisper about me
And we will dance in the dark
